* Two Kinds - Integers and Floats
- Arithmetic operations in digital systems doesn't produce same result as in traditional maths
** Integers
- Integer types except char, signed char and unsigned char may contain unused bits, called /padding/
- Value including /padding/ is called /width/
  *** /Integer Ranges/
      - Representable values - Values that can be represented based on the number of bits available. if not compiler may or may not convert them to representable
      - <limits.h> can be used to assign limits as it may vary system to system
